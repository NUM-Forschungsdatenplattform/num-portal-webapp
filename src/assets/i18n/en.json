Data must be collected in a standardized and timely manner, as well as centrally compiled and evaluated, in order to enable targeted research on COVID-19. This is where CODEX comes in."

This is implemented through feasibility queries and, if the conditions for use are met, a central data output. This enables national and international researchers to evaluate highly relevant data on COVID-19 diseases and thus to contribute to the fight against the pandemic. HiGHmed e.V. oversees the operational management of the CODEX user portal."

Structured data serves as the basis for novel scientific evaluation and helps in the development of evidence-based decision support systems. CODEX contributes to a rapid knowledge gain and thus to improved crisis management in pandemic emergencies as well as to an optimized public health design. This results in the following benefits:<ul><li>For patients: Best possible care for COVID-19 patients through rapid generation and dissemination of evidence and consideration of legal and ethical issues.</li><li>For researchers: Robust data base for scientific research in the context of COVID-19.</li><li>For business: creating the basis for vaccine and drug development as well as training artificial intelligence.</li><li>For decision-makers: the optimization of crisis management in epidemic emergencies as well based on scientific facts.</li><li>For physicians and authorities: Pandemic management and patient care can be improved and relieved through innovative, high-quality services and applications.</li></ul>"
