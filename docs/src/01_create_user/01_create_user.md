# Create User

Before you can start using CODEX you have to create a new user account for your personal work.

A user account can be created by each indiviual by providing a company or institution email
address. The responsive organization admin has to approve this new account before the user can 
log in again and start working on research projects.

## Sign up a new user account

To create a new user account navigate to the sign up page which you can find by clicking "SIGN IN"
at the main naviation. You will be asked to accept storing cookies on your machine. Accept and this
will lead you to the "Login-Page". Hit "Register" below the login form to start a new account
registration.
