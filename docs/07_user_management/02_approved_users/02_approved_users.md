# Approved user management

This section covers the management of approved users which will be necessary if the role of an
existing user changes, e.g. a user gets new tasks and requires to use additional features of
RDP.

```{important}
The following steps can only be executed by users with the role **Organization Admin** or **Super
Admin**.
```

The *approved users* list provides information about all users in your organization (or the whole portal for *Super Admins*). The list can be searched via the *search* field in the upper right corner. For *Super Admins* the list also provides an option to filter the list for only the own organization. In the column *roles* you can see all roles that have been assigned to a user. If you want to edit these, just click on the *pencil* symbol at the beginning of the row and act like described in section [Unapproved Users](../01_unapproved_users/01_unapproved_users.md).

```{important}
It is not possible to deactivate a user. However, if you want to revoke all permissions for a user, just uncheck all roles in the role assignment dialog. The user can now only access the welcome page and no further features of the portal.
