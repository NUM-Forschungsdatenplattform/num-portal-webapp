# User Management

The user management page can be used by Organization Admins or Super Admins to approve users
and assign or remove roles of users.

```{important}
Only users with the **Super Admin** or **Organization Admin** roles can access the user management feature. **Organization Admins** can only access users of their respective organization.
```
