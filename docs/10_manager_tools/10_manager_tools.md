# Manager tools

This section covers the manager tools feature.

```{important}
Only users with the **Manager** role can access the manager tools feature.
```

The manager tools provide two charts of the SOFA-Score. The left-hand chart represents the average SOFA-Score per clinic, that provided data for the RDP platform. The right-hand chart provides a dropdown to select a specific clinic to access their patients SOFA-Scores.
